*DESCRIPTION*:
Project Title: Rent Calculator Using Python
The Rent Calculator project is a simple Python-based application developed to automate the process of calculating rental expenses over a specified duration. It was designed to assist users in determining how much they would need to pay for rent over a number of months, including any additional recurring monthly charges such as maintenance, utilities, or service fees.
The program works through a command-line interface. It begins by prompting the user to input three key pieces of information: the monthly rent amount, the total number of months, and any additional monthly charges. Once these inputs are received, the program calculates the total cost by first determining the monthly total (base rent plus extra charges) and then multiplying that value by the number of months specified. Finally, a neatly formatted summary of the rent breakdown is displayed.

This project makes use of fundamental Python programming concepts including variables, arithmetic operations, conditional handling, and formatted output. User input is gathered using the input() function, and data is converted into the appropriate types (float for currency values and int for duration). A try-except block is used to handle any invalid inputs, such as entering a word instead of a number, which helps avoid runtime errors and ensures a smooth user experience.
One of the highlights of the project is its user-friendly design. Even though it runs in the terminal, clear headings, spacing, and even emojis are used to make the interface more engaging and easy to understand. For example, each section of the summary—like monthly rent, total payment, and duration—is clearly labeled, making it suitable even for users with minimal technical background.

From a technical perspective, I used basic Python concepts such as variables, user input, type conversion (using float() and int()), arithmetic operations, string formatting, and exception handling with try-except blocks. Using the try-except block allowed me to handle incorrect inputs and guide the user to enter valid numbers, which is an important part of making any program user-friendly.

The Rent Calculator serves as a practical tool for individuals and families managing their monthly budgets, as well as for landlords who want a quick way to estimate rent collections. It also represents an ideal starting point for anyone interested in programming, as it demonstrates how basic coding skills can be applied to solve everyday problems.
